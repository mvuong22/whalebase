Whale Base is a Java-based console application that serves as a simple data management system for recording and organizing whale species information. Users can interact with the program through a clear text-based menu that allows them to manually add new whale records or upload them from a text file. Each whale entry includes details such as species ID, scientific name, common name, size, weight, conservation status, and habitat. The system ensures data accuracy through validation checks for each field, such as enforcing numeric formats, restricting letters for names, and limiting conservation status to predefined categories.

The program fully supports CRUD operations;Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Allowing users to build and maintain a fun and educational database. During testing, emphasis was placed on identifying edge cases such as invalid user input, missing data in uploaded files, and file path errors. These tests helped refine exception handling and input validation, ensuring smoother user interaction and preventing crashes.
